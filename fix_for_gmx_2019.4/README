This fixes gmx bug #3403 (https://gitlab.com/gromacs/gromacs/-/issues/3403) in gmx 2019.4,
at least for cases where ligand is smaller than rlist. The remaining effect on free energies is small.

For safe handling of ligand expanding beyond rlist during the simulation, use gmx 2021 or newer instead.
That version has a runtime check and crashes (on purpose) when this occurs to prevent incorrect results.

Typically, mdrun tunes rlist when it starts, ignoring the value specified in the mdp.
To overcome that, use these mdp settings:

verlet-buffer-tolerance  = -1
rlist                    = 2.2 ; (nm) or large enough for the maximum expected extent of the decoupled ligand



Unfortunately, a larger rlist makes simulations noticeably slower while only marginably changing the free energy,
so the simulations in the paper used the patched 2019.4 version with automatic rlist values.
